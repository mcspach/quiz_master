This is a Ruby on Rails project. The quiz portion relies heavily on Javascript. There is still some work to be for full scalability of the product, but the testing database and build is up and running.

This project is modelled after a microlearning application for Le Wagon Mexico Batch #483 coding bootcamp. 

The primary design and all design assets were created by Matthew Spach.
